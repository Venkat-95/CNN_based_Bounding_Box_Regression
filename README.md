# CNN based Bounding Box Regression

This project is an end to end implementation of a CNN based bounding box regression technique for detection of
Automobile license plates.

The model developed is a very simple and linear model which has a series of Convolution and Pooling layers 
applied sequentially in order to understand the theoretical concepts behind the CNNs and visualize the practical 
performance on a real world use case. 

### Annotation and Preprocessing

All training and test data has to be saved under the folder **data**. The annotations can be either in XML format or
 a json file. The data is picked up automatically from this folder and preprocessed. All the original images
gathered should be saved under the path **data/images**.
